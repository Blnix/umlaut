# umlaut

You can use custom double characters like "ae" to create an "ä". Completely customisable!
Use a dictionary like: 
```python
umlauts = {
  "ae": "ä",
  "ee": "é"
}
```

It has a pause function, on standard using the button scroll lock, but customisable as well.

It plays a sound, when activated/deactivated!
